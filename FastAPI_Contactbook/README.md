FastAPI Contactbook(FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)

This is a project documenting my learning process in backend development. In this project, I had 3 mini projects to learn about different skills I need to complete the full project.
Here is the list of projects and what I learned from them:

1. A workout tracker: I used this mini-project to understand the basics of pydantic and fastAPI
2. A notes app: I used this mini-project to understand how to integrate fastAPI with SQL
3. A user database: I used this mini-project to learn about SQAlchemy and modularization

The main project is a contactbook made with FastAPI and SQAlechemy in a crud format. I learned how to structure a full backend(Modularization, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy), handle database integrations properly, and connect it all to a frontend.

How to Run(Main Project):
1. Install Dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Start the backend using uvicorn

 uvicorn main:app --reload

3. Open index.html to access the frontend


If you would like to run the mini-projects, you will install the requiremnts the same way as the main project and run the following command:

 cd .\Mini-projects\

To run mini-project-1 & mini-project-2, run the following command(respective to which one you want to open):

 uvicorn mini-project-1:app --reload

 uvicorn mini-project-2:app --reload

And just open their respective html file to access the frontend.

To run mini-project-3, follow this steps:

1. Install Dependencies

 pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Go to the project location

 cd .\Mini-projects\mini-project-3\

3. Start the backend

  uvicorn main:app --reload

4. Open index.html to access the frontend



P.S: All the frontend in this project is AI-generated.
