This repository contains projects I build as I learn to think like an engineer. Each project is part of my effort to improve my critical thinking, problem solving, and coding skills.

Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my learning process through hands-on coding. I use these projects to explore new concepts, practice techniques, and build a foundation for future work.

What's Inside
Projects will vary in scope and topic, but may include:
- Python scripts and tools
- Database projects using SQLite
- Exercises focused on logic and problem solving
- Experiments with machine learning
  
Notes
This repository will grow over time as I continue learning and building. It's a reflection of my progress and a place to share what I'm working on.
