The Pulse API - High Speed Uptime Monitor

A high-speed, multi-threaded uptime monitor built to demonstrate concurrency in Python. 
It scans dozens of websites simultaneously using a custom threading engine and stores results in a local SQLite database.

Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI (Python 3.10+)

Database: SQLite + SQLAlchemy

Concurrency: concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor

Frontend: HTML5 + CSS (GENERATED BY AI)



Key Features

Parallel Scanning: Checks 50+ sites in seconds (vs minutes sequentially).

CRUD System: Add, Edit, and Delete targets dynamically.

Smart Optimization: Uses in-memory hash maps to prevent database thrashing.

Debounced Search: Filters targets instantly without API spam.


How to run:

    1. Install Dependecies
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    2. Run the Server
        uvicorn main:app --reload

    3. Open Dashboard
        open index.html in your browser

This will project will help me solidify my understanding in Pydantic, FastAPI for RESTful endpoints, 
SQLAlchemy for persistent state management, and ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel network I/O as I work towards becoming not just a coder but an ML Engineer.

P.S: Frontend generated by AI.
