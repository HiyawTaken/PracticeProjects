Crypto Aggregator

This is a simple project I did to understand the uses of multithreading.

The program pulls bitcoin prices from 4 free API's(Coinbase, CoinGecko, Bitstamp, Binance) sequentially and concurrently
and compares the time they took to do the same thing.

How to run:

    1. Install Dependency
        python install -r requirements.txt

    2. Run the program
        python crypto_aggregator.py
