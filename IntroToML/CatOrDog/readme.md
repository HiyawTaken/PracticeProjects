This API is designed to use the theta and theta stats npy file made by my logistic regression model.

First, it receives an image from our API, and it converts the image to black and white a 64*64 image(our model was trained on this kind of images), and translate that into an array of pixels. Then normalize that data to do a matrix multiplication with our parameters(thetas). Then that data is run through the logistic function(sigmoid) to minimize the data between 0 and 1.
It then sends out the results back to the request.

**How to Run**

You will need an Nvidia GPU to run this.

    1. Install Dependencies
    
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    2. Start the Backend
        
        uvicorn CatImageIdentifierAPI:app --reload

    3. Open CatVSDog.html to access the frontend

P.S: The frontend code is generated by AI.
