Statistics CLI (Standard Math Library)

This project focused on mastering data fundamentals and distribution moments without using external libraries. 
I built this to strengthen my statistics foundation and prepare for a future project involving Bitcoin price prediction. I also added a script to clean-up a csv file of bitcoin price history to make a new csv with only prices for easier data processing.

What I learned:

I learned how to implement descriptive statistics from scratch, including central tendency, dispersion, and higher-order moments like skewness and kurtosis, to identify "fat-tail" risks and outliers in financial data.


How to Run:

    1. Start the CLI
        python main.py

    2. Analyze Data
        Choose to enter numbers manually or load a `.csv` file to generate a full statistical profile.
